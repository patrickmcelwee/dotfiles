This currently has my bash, tmux and some script files. Need to add: vim config file.

To install:

    git clone https://github.com/patrickmcelwee/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
    cd ~/dotfiles
    ./install_dotfiles.sh

This will make a backup of any config files that are not symlinks. They will be placed into ~/dotfiles\_old
